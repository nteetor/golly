# golly

golly is very very much a work in progress. The [G2](https://github/antvis/g2)
project implements an incredible JavaScript for building visualizations. G2 is
based on the same grammar of graphics as ggplot2 and it shows. The goal of golly
is to provide a familiar toolset for R programmers to build interactive web
visualizations.

Furthermore, golly would be the visualization backbone of
the [dull](https://github.com/nteetor/dull). This is a ways off, but why not
keep an eye on the horizon?
